# CABco.-Taxi-Booking-Mobile-Application
CAB Co. is a hypothetical Taxi Booking Mobile Application which has a simple, minimalistic User Interface.
I've done this project for a certification by Coursera Project Network.

Attached is a Case Study emphasizing on how this mobile application cuts time of booking a taxi and how its simplistic approach towards the same helps anyone use the application with ease.
